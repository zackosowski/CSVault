Complete the ten challenges below using your Circuit Playground Device.

---
#### <i>1. Blinky</i>
Create a program that flashes all lights GREEN then off in 367ms intervals.

---
#### <i>2. Flip-Flop</i>
Create a program turns pixels 0-4 to green and pixels 5-9 to off when the switch is in the left position.

When the switch is in the right position, pixels 0-4 should be off and pixels 5-9 should be set to green.

---
#### <i>3. Woosh</i>
Create a program that turns pixels 0-9 on for 100ms then off for 100ms in number order when button A is pressed. It should appear as a single light is traveling through the circle of pixels on your board.

---
#### <i>4. Dice</i>
Create a program that randomly generates a number between one and 10 when button A is pressed. When the number is generated, the same number of pixels should light up on the board. When button B is pressed, all pixels should turn off. You may use any color for the pixels as long as they are all the same.

---
#### <i>5. Light Meter</i>
Create a program that turns on more pixels as the room gets darker. Starting at brightness 30, turn on 1 additional pixel for every 3 levels of brightness lower.
30 = 1 pixels
27 = 2 pixels
24 = 3 pixels
21 = 4 pixels
18 = 5 pixels
15 = 6 pixels
12 = 7 pixels
9 = 8 pixels
6 = 9 pixels
3 = 10 pixels

---
#### <i>6. Tippy</i>
Create a program that turns on pixels 1, 2, and 3 on as green when the board is tipped to the left. Pixels 6, 7, and 8 should light up red when the board is tipped to the right. Turn off the pixels on the opposite sides when flipped.

---
#### <i>7. Randomizer</i>
Create a program that sets all pixels to random colors when the board is shaken. Random colors should include every possible color. Each light a different color, not all the same color.

---
#### <i>8. Counter</i>
Create a program that counts with pixels. On startup, no pixels should be lit. When button A is pressed for the first time, pixel 0 should light up. Every press of button A after that should turn on another pixel. Every press of button B should turn off an LED. For example: pressing button A five times should result in five lit pixels. Pressing button B 2 times after that should result in three lit pixels. You may choose your pixel color but all pixels must be the same color.

---
#### <i>9. The Clapper</i>
Create a program that toggles all pixels on/off when you clap.

Clap to turn them on, clap to turn them off.

---
#### <i>10. Police Simulator</i>
Create a program that flashes all pixels red/blue in 500ms intervals and also alternates between two police siren tones (500hz & 900hz)
