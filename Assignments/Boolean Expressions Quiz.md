Test your knowledge of Boolean expressions by creating a simple quiz that tests the user's understanding of comparison and logical operators.

---
#### Overview

Create a quiz. The questions must be given with [[Input Functions|input() statements]] and the answers stored as variables. After the question is answered, your program should print if the given answer was `True` or `False`

The questions should ask the user to evaluate Boolean expressions. For example:

```python
answer = int(input("Give a whole number that is less than 5.\n"))
print(answer < 5)
```

<span style="position: relative; font-weight: 700;background-color: #C80000; border-bottom: 2px solid #C80000;padding-top:1px; padding-bottom:1px;  padding-left: 11px; padding-right: 7px;border-top: 2px solid #C80000; border-radius:10px 0px 0px 10px;">!</span><span style= "background-color: #520000; margin-left:-14px;padding:3px;padding-left:14px; padding-right:10px;border-right:3px solid #C80000"> The input function always returns a String, so the answer may need to be converted.</span>
