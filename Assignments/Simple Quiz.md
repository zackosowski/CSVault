Create a quiz that asks questions and tallies your score at the end.

---
#### Overview
Use input statements to ask questions and store the answers as variables. Create a function called `tally_score` that checks if the answers are correct. Use if statements to check answers.

Clarity:
Input statements outside the function, if statements inside the function. No function parameters needed.
