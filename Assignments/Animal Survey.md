Create a program that surveys the user about their favorite animal. This activity will help you practice using `input` and `print` functions, working with strings, and storing data in variables.

---
#### Overview
Ask the user a number of questions with the first being "What is your favorite animal?".

The following questions will ask for details about the animal, for example:
* "Why is this your favorite animal?"
* "What sound does the animal make?"

When finished, the program should print a summary of the answers you gave.
