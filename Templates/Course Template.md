#### Course Overview

#### Units



<hr>
#### Grading

Grading is broken down into formative and summative assessments. Formative assessments are activities. Summative assessments include projects and tests.

<hr>
#### Inclusion

It is my goal as an educator to embrace and encourage my students’ differences in their immutable and cultural characteristics that make them unique. Above all else, students will be seen as individuals who bring unique and valuable perspectives to the classroom. I expect my students to respect this philosophy and help foster an environment where everyone belongs.

<hr>
#### Phone Use

Cell phones are not allowed in the classroom. If a student brings in a cell phone, they must put it in the phone holder upon entry to the room. Phones brought in and not placed in the phone holder will be sent to the office.

<hr>
#### Absence/Tardiness

If a student expects an upcoming absence, they must talk with me prior to that absence to discuss solutions for making up any missed work. In most cases, students will be working on projects and will need to communicate with their group members about project tasks they may need to make up.

If a student is not in the classroom when the bell rings, they will be marked as tardy in the gradebook. A written referral will be issued to the student on their fourth tardy of the trimester.

#### Vandalism/Theft

Because students use our valuable and sensitive technical equipment daily, it is crucial that we all exhibit respectful and proper use of it. Vandalism and theft involving school equipment will be handled in accordance with the Student Handbook:

*“The principal may suspend or recommend expulsion of a student who violates one or more of the following specific standards of conduct while on school grounds, during a school sponsored activity, or during a school-related activity.*

1. *Causes or attempts to cause damage to school property, stealing or attempts to steal school property of value.*
    
2. *Causes or attempts to cause damage to private property, stealing or attempts to steal private property.”*

#### Comments/Concerns

I would love to chat with you through email for any questions regarding any of the policies listed above or for any other concerns relating to this class. I try my best to make myself as accessible as possible to best serve my students. Please email me at zacharyo@mystma.org.
