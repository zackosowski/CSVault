Welcome to Mr. Osowski's Computer Science Program! This resource is designed to be used as a curriculum tool while taking my classes, but can also be used as a self-guided learning experience.

#### Background
<hr>

Hi, I'm Mr. Osowski. I am high school computer science teacher at St. Michael-Albertville High School in St. Michael Minnesota. I have built up this resource over many years of designing, executing, failing, iterating, and succeeding in getting young people excited about computer science. If you are a student of mine, you are in the right place. If you are not a student, welcome!
