A float, short for "floating-point number," is a data type used to represent decimal numbers. Floats are used when a greater range or precision than that offered by [[Integer|integers]] is required. They are typically used to represent real numbers, such as 3.14 or -0.001.

Floats are stored in [[memory]] using a format that allows a fixed number of digits in the mantissa (significant digits) and an exponent to specify the scale of the number. This allows floats to represent a wide range of values, both very large and very small, with a limited amount of memory.

However, it's important to note that due to the nature of floating-point representation in [[binary]], there can be precision and rounding errors when performing arithmetic operations with floats. Therefore, for applications requiring exact precision, such as financial calculations, other data types like decimals or fixed-point numbers might be more appropriate.
