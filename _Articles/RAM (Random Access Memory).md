Random Access Memory are physical components of a computer that are responsible for temporary storage of [[Data|data]]. Things like web page data (text, images, video), active programs, and background process data are stored in RAM temporarily until they are not needed anymore. All data stored in RAM is lost when the computer is powered off.

RAM is purchased in "sticks" with each stick referred to as one "channel"
* 1 stick = single channel
* 2 sticks = dual channel
* 4 sticks = quad channel
* Having more channels of RAM allows for parallel RAM storage processing. Your computer can read/write to multiple sticks of ram at the same time for increased efficiency

RAM is measured in storage size (Gb), speed (MHz), and DDR version.
* More RAM storage will allow you to do things like open more tabs in google chrome without your computer slowing down
* RAM speed refers to the data read/write speed
* DDR stands for double data rate, a data transfer strategy used by RAM modules
	* Larger number = newer version
	* Newer versions = fast time to response to read/write requests
	* Newest version is DDR5

The most important aspect of RAM is its storage capacity. Most modern computers have between 8-16gb of RAM
* 4gb = low
* 8gb = good
* 16gb = great
* 32gb = amazing
