Computer processors consist of a bunch of tiny switches called "transistors".
* these transistors can either be ON or OFF, just like a light switch
* on and off positions are referred to as 1 and 0
* electrical signals flip the switches to 1 and 0
* the binary number system allows us to give meaning to 1s and 0s
* every computer uses these 1s and 0s to execute every task
* every file on your computer is just a series of 1s and 0s
	
A single 1 or 0 is the smallest unit of data in a computer- a "**bit**"
* a group of eight bits is called a **byte**
* 1024 bytes is called a **kilobyte**
* 1024 kilobytes is called a **megabyte**
* 1024 megabytes is called a **gigabyte**
* 1024 gigabytes is called a **terabyte**
* 1024 terabytes is called a **petabyte**
	

Numeral systems are writing systems for expressing numbers. Everyday, you use a base 10 number system called the decimal system. "Deci" meaning 10. Base 10 because we have 10 fingers. Here is an example of how we represent the number 125 in the decimal system.

| 100 | 10  | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 5   |




Computer systems operate in a base 2 system called Binary. Base 2 because transistors have 2 positions, 1 or 0.

| 100 | 10  | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | 2   | 5   |
