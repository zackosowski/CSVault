Character mapping involves the assignment of numerical codes or symbols to characters for storage and processing purposes. Your computer uses tables of numerical values to represent characters. A character mapping system that you have probably heard of before is Morse Code.

In computer science, the most common character mapping systems are ASCII and Unicode. Here is the complete ASCII character map:

| Dec | Char | Dec | Char | Dec | Char |
| --- | ---- | --- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| 32  |      | 64  | @    | 96  | `    |
| 33  | !    | 65  | A    | 97  | a    |
| 34  | "    | 66  | B    | 98  | b    |
| 35  | #    | 67  | C    | 99  | c    |
| 36  | $    | 68  | D    | 100 | d    |
| 37  | %    | 69  | E    | 101 | e    |
| 38  | &    | 70  | F    | 102 | f    |
| 39  | '    | 71  | G    | 103 | g    |
| 40  | (    | 72  | H    | 104 | h    |
| 41  | )    | 73  | I    | 105 | i    |
| 42  | *    | 74  | J    | 106 | j    |
| 43  | +    | 75  | K    | 107 | k    |
| 44  | ,    | 76  | L    | 108 | l    |
| 45  | -    | 77  | M    | 109 | m    |
| 46  | .    | 78  | N    | 110 | n    |
| 47  | /    | 79  | O    | 111 | o    |
| 48  | 0    | 80  | P    | 112 | p    |
| 49  | 1    | 81  | Q    | 113 | q    |
| 50  | 2    | 82  | R    | 114 | r    |
| 51  | 3    | 83  | S    | 115 | s    |
| 52  | 4    | 84  | T    | 116 | t    |
| 53  | 5    | 85  | U    | 117 | u    |
| 54  | 6    | 86  | V    | 118 | v    |
| 55  | 7    | 87  | W    | 119 | w    |
| 56  | 8    | 88  | X    | 120 | x    |
| 57  | 9    | 89  | Y    | 121 | y    |
| 58  | :    | 90  | Z    | 122 | z    |
| 59  | ;    | 91  | [    | 123 | {    |
| 60  | <    | 92  | \    | 124 | \|   |
| 61  | =    | 93  | ]    | 125 | }    |
| 62  | >    | 94  | ^    | 126 | ~    |
| 63  | ?    | 95  | _    |     |      |
There are 128 ASCII characters that can be represented by numerical codes.

The other common character mapping system used in computer science is Unicode. Unicode is a more robust system that includes symbols from all of the world's major writing systems. Version 15.1 of Unicode defines 149, 813 characters. For this reason, Unicode is usually only used in applications that need to accommodate multiple languages.
