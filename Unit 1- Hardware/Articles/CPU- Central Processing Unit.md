The central processing unit is the physical component of a computer that process data. 

The CPU contains millions or even BILLIONS of transistors.

The CPU is the brain of the computer
* Does all the thinking
* Performs math in numbers fed to it
* Computational speed measured in Gigahertz (GHz)
	* Most modern CPUs have speeds in the 2-3 GHz range
	* 1 GHz = 1,000,000,000 operations per second!

CPUs now can have multiple cores
* Cores are the devices inside the CPU that can preform mathematical operations, load info from memory, save info to memory, etc.
* The more cores, the more tasks a CPU can do at once

CPUs now also support hyper-threading
* Where a single core will present itself as multiple cores to a computerâ€™s operating system

#### SOC- System on a Chip
<hr>
  
Systems on a Chip (SoC) are when a CPU and more are all interconnected at once rather than attached to a motherboard

- Popular in phones, tables, and game consoles
- Raspberry Pi
- Arduino devices

#### Notes
<hr>
  * The first general purpose, commercially available, programmable CPU was developed by Intel in 1971
	  * Intel 4004
	  * 2,300 transistors

CPUs have been getting smaller and more powerful every year for decades. In fact, this progression is so predictable that it has a name; Moore's Law. Research Moore's Law online to learn more about the progression of CPU computational power over time.

On a Windows computer, you can check the current status of your CPU using the Windows Task Manager. Open your task manager and navigate to the "Performance" tab to view information about your CPU including speed and usage percentage.
