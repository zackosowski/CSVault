#### Key Features

**Cross-Platform:** 
	VS Code runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it accessible to users on different [[Operating System|operating systems]].

**Extensibility:**
	One of VS Code's strongest features is its extensibility. Users can install extensions to add new languages, [[Debugging|debuggers]], themes, and other tools, customizing the editor to fit their specific needs.

**IntelliSense:**
	This feature provides smart code completions based on [[Variables|variable]] types, [[Functions|function]] definitions, and imported modules, helping programmers write code more efficiently.

**Integrated Git:**
	VS Code includes built-in [[Git and GitHub|Git]] support, allowing users to manage version control without leaving the editor.

**Debugging:**
	The editor offers powerful debugging tools, enabling users to set [[breakpoints]], inspect variables, and control execution flow directly within the code.

**User Interface:**

- **Activity Bar:** Located on the side, it lets users switch between views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run & Debug, and Extensions.
- **Editor Window:** The main area where users write and edit code. It supports multiple tabs and split views.
- **Status Bar:** Displays important information such as current branch, line number, and errors/warnings.

**Usage:** VS Code supports many programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Java, C++, and more. It is particularly favored in web development due to its support for JavaScript and TypeScript. With its robust extension marketplace, users can enhance their development environment with tools for linting, formatting, snippets, themes, and more.
