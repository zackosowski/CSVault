**Concatenation** is a basic operation in computer science that involves linking or joining things together in a series. Most commonly, it refers to combining [[String|strings]]. When you concatenate two strings, you simply attach one string to the end of another.

#### String Concatenation

In many [[Programming Language|programming languages]], concatenation is done using specific [[operators]] or [[functions]]. For example:

- **[[Python]]**: You use the `+` operator.
  ```python
  string1 = "Hello"
  string2 = "World"
  result = string1 + " " + string2  # result is "Hello World"
  ```

- **JavaScript**: The `+` operator is also used.
  ```javascript
  let string1 = "Hello";
  let string2 = "World";
  let result = string1 + " " + string2;  // result is "Hello World"
  ```

- **C#**: You can use the `+` operator.
  ```C#
  String string1 = "Hello";
  String string2 = "World";
  String result = string1 + " " + string2;  // result is "Hello World"
  ```

#### Array Concatenation

Concatenation is not limited to strings. You can also concatenate arrays. For example, in Python:
```python
array1 = [1, 2, 3]
array2 = [4, 5, 6]
result = array1 + array2  # result is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
