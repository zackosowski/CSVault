In computer science, a statement is a single line of code that performs a specific action. Statements are the building blocks of a program, instructing the [[Computers and Computing|computer]] on what to do step by step. Each statement typically corresponds to a specific instruction in the computer's underlying [[Machine Code|machine language]].

#### Types of Statements

1. **Expression Statements**: These are the most common type of statements. Here are three main types of expression statements with examples:
	* assignments
		* `x = 5`
		* `color = "yellow"`
		* `dog1 = Dog()`
	* function call
		* `print(x)
		* `input("What is the password?)`
		* `cities.append("Minneapolis)`
	* mathematical operations
		* `y = x + 2` 

1. **Control Flow Statements**: These statements determine the order in which instructions are executed. Examples include:
    
    - **[[Conditional Statements]]**: Such as `if`, `else if`, and `else`, which allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions (e.g., `if (x > 10) { ... }`).

    - **[[Loop Statements]]**: Such as `for`, `while`, and `do-while`, which repeat a block of code multiple times (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) { ... }`).

1. **Jump Statements**: These alter the flow of control unconditionally. Examples include [[Break Statement|break]] (exits a loop), [[Continue Statement|continue]] (skips the current iteration of a loop), and `return` (exits a function).
    
4. **Declaration Statements**: These are used to declare variables and constants, defining their type and optionally initializing them (e.g., `int age = 16;`).
