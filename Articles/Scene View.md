In [[Unity Game Engine|Unity]], the Scene view is a workspace that allows developers to design and arrange their game environments. It presents a flat, orthographic view of the game world, where you can place and manipulate 2D sprites, tiles, and UI elements. The Scene view provides tools for positioning, rotating, and scaling these objects, making it easy to create complex layouts and interactions. Developers can also see real-time updates as they make changes, allowing for immediate feedback on gameplay elements. This view is essential for building new scenes, ensuring an intuitive and efficient design process.
