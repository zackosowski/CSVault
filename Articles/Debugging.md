**Debugging** is the process of identifying, analyzing, and fixing bugs or [[Errors|errors]] in software. Bugs are flaws or issues in a [[Computers and Computing|computer]] program that cause it to produce incorrect or unexpected results or to behave in unintended ways. Debugging is a critical skill for programmers, as it ensures that software functions correctly and efficiently.

#### History and Origin

The term "debugging" dates back to the early days of computing. One famous anecdote involves computer scientist Grace Hopper finding a moth causing issues in the Mark II computer in 1947, which she referred to as a "bug." Removing the moth was called "debugging," and the term has been used ever since.

#### Debugging Process

1. **Reproduce the Bug**: The first step in debugging is to reproduce the problem. This means running the program in a way that consistently causes the bug to appear.
2. **Diagnose the Problem**: Next, the programmer needs to understand why the bug occurs. This often involves reading through the error messages, checking for logical errors in the code, and using debugging tools.
3. **Fix the Bug**: Once the cause of the bug is identified, the programmer makes changes to the code to correct the issue.
4. **Test the Solution**: After making a fix, it is crucial to test the program to ensure that the bug is resolved and that no new bugs have been introduced.

#### Tools and Techniques

Programmers use various tools and techniques to debug their code:

- **Print Statements**: Adding [[Print Functions|print]] statements in the code to display [[Data|values]] of [[variables]] and the flow of execution. This is a simple but effective way to understand what the program is doing.
- **Debuggers**: Special software tools, such as gdb (GNU Debugger) for C/C++ or the integrated debugger in [[IDE (Integrated Development Environment)|IDEs]]. These tools allow programmers to step through code line by line, inspect variables, and control the execution flow.
- **Unit Testing**: Writing tests for individual parts of the code (units) to ensure they work correctly. Automated testing frameworks like JUnit for Java or PyTest for [[Python]] are commonly used.
- **Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explaining the code and the problem to a rubber duck (or any inanimate object) as a way to clarify the programmer's thinking and often reveal the bug's source.

#### Debugging Golden Question

Sometimes, finding the error in your code can be a confusing and frustrating process. When in doubt, ask yourself the "debugging golden question":

*"What changed since it worked last?"*
