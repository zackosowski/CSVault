In Unity, the Inspector window provides detailed information and settings for the currently selected game object. It displays all the components attached to that object, allowing developers to view and modify properties such as transforms, scripts, and physics settings. The Inspector enables real-time adjustments, making it easy to tweak values and see immediate results in the Scene view or Game view. Additionally, it supports custom editor scripts, allowing developers to create tailored interfaces for their components. Overall, the Inspector is essential for fine-tuning game objects and managing their behavior in the Unity environment.
