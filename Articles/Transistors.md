Transistors are small hardware devices made of semiconductors that act as switches for electric current. Because transistors are made of semiconductors, transistors can behave as both insulators (materials that inhibit electron flow) and conductors (materials that enable electron flow). When a small current is provided into a transistor’s gate, the gate “opens” and current can flow from the source to the sink. When no current is available at the gate, the gate “closes” and current cannot flow from the source to the sink. By controlling current flowing into the gate, transistors can manipulate how current flows and therefore which signals are sent.
