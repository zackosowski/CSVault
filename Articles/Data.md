Put very simply, data is information. Numbers, words, colors, sizes, times, locations, positions, lengths, widths, you get the point. Everything is data.

#### Data Types

Not all data is made equal. In fact, data comes in many forms and types, and those types matter.

For example, if I asked you how old you are, I would expect to receive a number back. But if you responded to the question with something like "Fortnite", I would be terribly confused. This is because there is a mismatch between the type of data I expected to receive and the type of data you gave me. I wanted a number but you gave me a random word....

Here are some common data types (there are many more)
* [[Integer]] (whole numbers, can be positive or negative, or zero)
* [[Float]] (floating point number aka decimal number)
* [[Character]] (a single character)
* [[String]] (a group or "string" of characters)
* [[Boolean]] (a special type of data that can only be True or False)
