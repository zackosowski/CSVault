A **programming language** is a formal system of communication used to write instructions that a [[Computers and Computing|computer]] can execute. These languages allow programmers to create software, apps, websites, and other digital tools by specifying the tasks the computer should perform.

#### Key Differences

**Syntax and Semantics**: 
   - **[[Syntax]]** refers to the rules that define the structure of valid statements in the language, similar to grammar in human languages.
   - **Semantics** is about the meaning of these statements and what actions they will cause the computer to perform.

**High-Level vs. Low-Level Languages**:
   - **High-Level Languages**: These are closer to human languages and easier to read and write. Examples include Python, Java, and C++. They are designed to be user-friendly and are often portable across different computer systems.
   - **Low-Level Languages**: These are closer to [[machine code]], which the computerâ€™s hardware can execute directly. Examples include Assembly language and machine code itself. They offer more control over hardware but are more difficult to write and understand.

**Compilation and Interpretation**:
   - **Compiled Languages**: Programs written in these languages, like C or C++, are translated into machine code by a [[compiler]] before they run. This can make them faster but requires a separate compilation step.
   - **Interpreted Languages**: Programs written in these languages, like Python or JavaScript, are executed line-by-line by an interpreter, making them easier to test and [[Debugging|debug]] but potentially slower.
