Conditionals statements are statements that allow a program to make decisions and execute certain sections of code based on whether specific [[Boolean Expression (Condition)|conditions]] are true or false. They are fundamental to controlling the flow of a program, enabling it to respond differently to varying inputs or situations.

See [[If Statements]] for more information.
