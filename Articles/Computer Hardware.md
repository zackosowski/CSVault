Computer hardware refers to the physical components of a computer system that you can touch and interact with. These components include devices such as the [[CPU  (Central Processing Unit)]], [[Memory]] modules ([[RAM (Random Access Memory)|RAM]]), storage devices ([[HDD (Hard Disk Drive)|hard drives]], [[SSD (Solid State Drive)|solid-state drives]]), input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen), output devices (monitor, printer, speakers), and various peripheral devices (such as network cards, graphics cards, and [[USB (Universal Serial Bus)|USB]] devices).

#### How does it work?

Computer hardware works together to perform tasks and execute programs. The [[CPU  (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]], often considered the "brain" of the computer, executes instructions and processes data. Memory ([[RAM (Random Access Memory)|RAM]]) stores data and instructions that are currently being used by the CPU. Storage devices, such as [[HDD (Hard Disk Drive)|hard drives]] and [[SSD (Solid State Drive)|SSDs]], store data persistently even when the computer is powered off. The [[motherboard]] provides electrical connections and pathways that allow [[data]] and power to flow between the different components of the computer.

#### Input/Output

Input devices allow users to interact with the computer by providing data or commands, while output devices display information or results to the user. Peripheral devices extend the functionality of the computer, enabling tasks such as networking, graphics processing, and additional storage.
