In computer science, "syntax" refers to the rules and structure that govern how [[Programming Language|programming languages]] are written. It's like the grammar of a language but for [[Computers and Computing|computers]].

Syntax defines the rules that programmers must follow when writing code. Just as in spoken languages, where sentences have specific structures, programming languages have their own syntax rules. This includes using correct punctuation, spacing, and [[Keyword|keywords]] as required by the language.

 When syntax is violated, [[Errors#**Syntax Errors**|syntax errors]] occur. These errors are detected by the [[compiler]] or interpreter, which highlights the mistakes so they can be corrected before running the program.

#### Analogy to English

In English, punctuation marks such as periods, commas, and question marks play crucial roles in conveying meaning and structure. For example:

- "I like apples, oranges, and bananas."
- "What time is it?"

Similarly, in programming, punctuation marks serve distinct purposes. In Python, for instance:

* `fruits = ["apples", "oranges", "bananas"]
* `question = "What time is it?"`

In the first example, square brackets indicate the start and end of a list, and the commas separate items in that list. 

In the second example, quotations indicate the start and end of a [[String]].
