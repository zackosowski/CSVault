Exception handling is a crucial aspect of programming that allows developers to manage errors and other exceptional conditions gracefully. In Python, exception handling is primarily done using `try` and `except` blocks. By anticipating potential errors in your code, you can prevent crashes and provide informative feedback to users.

#### Understanding Exceptions

Exceptions are events that disrupt the normal flow of a program. They can occur for various reasons, such as:

- Division by zero
- File not found
- Index out of range
- Invalid input

When an exception occurs, Python raises an error, which can halt the execution of the program. Exception handling enables you to catch these errors and respond appropriately.

#### Basic Syntax of Exception Handling

The basic structure of exception handling in Python involves the `try` and `except` blocks. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    numerator = 10
    denominator = 0
    result = numerator / denominator
except ZeroDivisionError:
    # Code to handle the exception
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
```

In this example, if the division by zero occurs, the code inside the `except` block will be executed, and the program will not crash.

#### Catching Multiple Exceptions

You can also handle multiple exceptions by specifying different `except` blocks for each type of exception. Here's how you can do that:

```python
try:
    # Code that may raise different exceptions
    value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / value
except ValueError:
    print("Error: Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
```

In this example, if the user enters a non-integer value, a `ValueError` will be raised, and the corresponding message will be displayed. If they enter zero, a `ZeroDivisionError` will be caught.

#### Using the Finally Clause

You can use the `finally` block to execute code that must run regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This is often used for cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources:

```python
file = None
try:
    file = open("example.txt", "r")
    # Perform file operations
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: File not found.")
finally:
    if file:
        file.close()
```

In this example, the file will be closed whether or not an error occurs while trying to open it.

#### Raising Exceptions

You can also raise exceptions manually using the `raise` statement. This can be useful when you want to enforce certain conditions in your code:

```python
def divide(numerator, denominator):
    if denominator == 0:
        raise ValueError("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
    return numerator / denominator

try:
    result = divide(10, 0)
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)
```

In this case, if the denominator is zero, a `ValueError` is raised with a custom message.

#### Practice Activity

Create a simple program that asks the user for two numbers and performs division. Use exception handling to manage the following cases:

1. Handle division by zero.
2. Handle invalid input (non-numeric values).
3. Ensure that any open resources, if applicable, are closed properly.

Make sure to test your program with various inputs to verify that all exceptions are handled correctly.
