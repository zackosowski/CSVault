In [[Unity Game Engine|Unity]], the Hierarchy window displays a structured list of all game objects in the current scene. It serves as a visual representation of the scene's object hierarchy, allowing developers to organize and manage game elements easily. Game objects can be nested in parent-child relationships, enabling complex structures and organization. The Hierarchy also provides quick access to select, rename, and delete objects, and it shows their active or inactive status. By using the Hierarchy, developers can efficiently navigate and manipulate the components that make up their game world.
