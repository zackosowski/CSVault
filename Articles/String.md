A string is a data type used to represent a sequence of [[Character|characters]]. Characters can include letters, digits, punctuation marks, and special symbols. Strings are widely used in programming for tasks involving text manipulation, such as input/output operations, parsing, and data processing.

Strings can be created using various programming languages, and they are typically enclosed within quotation marks. 

`"Hello, World!"`

Strings can be manipulated using various operations, such as concatenation (joining two strings together), substring extraction, searching for specific patterns, and replacing characters or substrings. Different programming languages provide different sets of functions or methods for working with strings.

Strings are immutable in some programming languages, meaning that once created, they cannot be changed. In other languages, strings may be mutable, allowing for in-place modifications.

Overall, strings are a fundamental data type in computer science and programming, playing a central role in representing and manipulating textual data in software applications.
