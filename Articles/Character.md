Character is a data type, often abbreviated as "char", is a fundamental data type used to represent a single character, such as a letter, digit, punctuation mark, or special symbol. In most programming languages, each character is encoded using a specific [[Character Mapping|encoding scheme]], such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) or Unicode.

In [[Memory]], each character typically occupies a fixed amount of space (often 8 bits or one byte), although some languages may use larger sizes to support extended character sets or Unicode encoding.

Character data types are widely used in various applications, including text processing, [[String]] manipulation, and user input/output operations. They are essential for representing textual data in computer programs.
