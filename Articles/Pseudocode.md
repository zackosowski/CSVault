Pseudocode serves as a bridge between the human mind and [[Computers and Computing|computer]] [[algorithms]]. It's a plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or program, designed to help programmers plan and communicate their ideas before translating them into a specific [[Programming Language]]. Let's delve into what pseudocode is with a few examples.

#### What is Pseudocode?

Pseudocode is like a blueprint for writing code. It's not tied to any particular programming language, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their algorithms rather than the [[syntax]]. Pseudocode typically uses a combination of natural language and common programming concepts to describe the steps of an algorithm.

#### Why Use Pseudocode?

* **Clarity**: Pseudocode breaks down complex algorithms into understandable steps.
* **Flexibility**: It allows developers to focus on logic before worrying about syntax.
* **Communication**: It's a universal language that aids in collaboration and communication among team members.
* **Debugging**: Identifying errors in logic is easier in pseudocode than in a specific programming language.
