In programming, a script is a type of program that is typically written in a scripting language and is designed to automate tasks or execute a sequence of instructions. Scripts are often interpreted rather than compiled, meaning they can be run directly by an interpreter without the need for a separate compilation step.

Key characteristics of scripts include:

1. **Ease of Use**: Scripts are usually simpler and shorter than full-fledged programs, making them easier to write and modify.

2. **Interpreted Languages**: Common scripting languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and Bash. These languages allow for quick development and testing.

3. **Automation**: Scripts are often used to automate repetitive tasks, such as file manipulation, data processing, and system administration tasks.

4. **Integration**: Scripts can often integrate with other software or systems, allowing them to control or interact with various applications.

5. **Cross-Platform**: Many scripting languages are designed to be cross-platform, allowing scripts to run on different operating systems with little or no modification.
