**[Git]([Git (git-scm.com)](https://git-scm.com/))** is a popular version control system that helps developers manage changes to their code. Created by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without overwriting each otherâ€™s work. It tracks changes in the files, so you can revert to previous versions if needed. Git works by creating snapshots of your files, which are stored in a repository. These snapshots can be shared and merged, making collaboration efficient and organized.

**[GitHub]([GitHub](https://github.com/)** is a web-based platform that uses Git for version control. Launched in 2008, GitHub provides a user-friendly interface for managing Git repositories online. It hosts your code in the cloud, allowing developers from around the world to contribute to the same project. GitHub also offers additional features like issue tracking, project management, and continuous integration.

#### Repository

A Repository is storage location for your project files and their version history. Repositories can be local (on your computer) or remote (on GitHub). This is essentially just a [[Computer File Systems|folder]].-

#### Commands

- **Clone:** Creating a copy of a remote repository on your local computer. This allows you to work on the project offline.
- **Pull:** Downloading changes from a remote repository to your local repository. This ensures your local copy is up to date with the remote version.
- **Commit:** A snapshot of your project's files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and usually includes a message describing the changes.
- **Push:** Uploading your local changes to a remote repository. This updates the remote repository with your latest commits.
