Understanding Classes and Objects is like unlocking the secret to building incredible digital worlds. These concepts serve as the foundation for creating complex programs and applications, making them essential for any aspiring programmer.

Imagine you are a website administrator and you need to keep data on hundreds over users, including name, email, password, and account preferences. Without classes and objects, you would need thousands of variables to keep track of all of that data. This would be extremely messy and hard to read!

#### What are Classes and Objects?

Think of a class as a blueprint or a template for creating something amazing. Just like how an architect uses blueprints to construct a building, programmers use classes to define the structure and behavior of objects in their code. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It's like the actual building constructed based on the architect's blueprint.

Imagine you have a class called "Dog." This class defines what a dog is â€“ it has attributes like name, age, and breed, and methods like "bark" and "fetch." Now, when you create an object from this class, say a Doberman Pincher named Wallace, you're essentially building a real dog based on the blueprint provided by the "Dog" class.

#### Attributes

Attributes, also known as properties or member variables, are the building blocks of an object's identity. They represent the data associated with an object, such as its characteristics or state. For instance, if we have a class called "Dog," its attributes might include properties like name, age, and breed.

Attributes are like the traits that distinguish one object from another. They are the object's data and provide a way to access and modify it. In our "Dog" example, we can set the age of a specific dog object to 2 or 10, change its name, or retrieve information about its breed.

Working with 1-2 people sitting next to you, list as many attributes as you can for the Dog class.

#### Methods

Methods, also known as member functions or behaviors, define what an object can do or how it can interact with the outside world. They are the object's functionality and provide a way to perform actions or operations on its data. Methods are just functions specific to a class or object.

Continuing with our "Dog" analogy, methods for a dog object might include functions like "bark", "fetch", or "sit." These methods enable us to manipulate the dog's behavior, such making it sit, making it run to fetch a ball, or making sound through a bark.

Methods are like the actions that an object can perform, allowing it to exhibit dynamic behavior beyond its static attributes. They are reusable pieces of code that operate on an object's data, promoting modularity and code organization.

| Class Name | Dog                  |
| ---------- | -------------------- |
| Attributes | Name<br>Age<br>Breed |
| Methods    | Bark<br>Fetch<br>Sit |

In the example above, the "Dog" class defines attributes like name, age, and breed, as well as methods like bark, fetch, and sit. By creating a dog object and interacting with its attributes and methods, we can control its behavior and observe its state.

Below is an example of an object created using the Dog class. Notice how the attributes now have values. This is because Dog1 is a specific, individual dog.

| Object Name | Dog1                                                      |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Class Name  | Dog                                                       |
| Attributes  | Name = "Wallace"<br>Age = 7<br>Breed = "Doberman Pincher" |
| Methods     | Bark<br>Fetch<br>Sit                                      |

#### Encapsulation and Abstraction

Classes also offer encapsulation and abstraction, two powerful concepts in programming. Encapsulation means bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data together within a class. This helps in organizing code and preventing unintended interference from outside. Abstraction, on the other hand, hides the complex implementation details of a class behind a simple interface. This allows programmers to use objects without needing to understand how they work internally.

---
#### Inheritance and Polymorphism

Two more key concepts related to classes are inheritance and polymorphism. Inheritance allows a class (called a subclass or child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (called a superclass or parent class). This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. Polymorphism, on the other hand, enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, simplifying code and making it more flexible.

Create a class called "Car" that has at least 5 attributes and and three class methods, then make five objects using the the class.
