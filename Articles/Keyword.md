In computer programming, keywords are reserved words that have special meanings. These words are part of the [[syntax]] of a [[Programming Language]] and cannot be used for naming [[Variables]], [[Functions (Python)]], or any other identifiers. They are essential for writing code that the [[Computers and Computing|computer]] can understand and execute.

#### Purpose of Keywords

Keywords are designed to perform specific functions within a programming language. They help define the structure and behavior of a program. For instance, they can be used to declare variables, create [[Loop Statements|loops]], make decisions, and [[Exception Handling|handle errors]].

#### Keywords of Python

Different programming languages have their own set of keywords. Here are all of the keywords in [[Python]]:

- **[[Boolean]] Values**: `True`, `False`, `None`
- **[[Statements#Control Flow Statements|Control Flow]]**: `if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`
- **[[Exception Handling]]**: `try`, `except`, `finally`, `raise`, `assert`
- **[[Functions (Python)]] and [[Classes and Objects|Classes]]:** `def`, `return`, `lambda`, `class`
- **[[Importing|Imports]]:** `import`, `from`, `as`
- **[[Operators|Logical Operators]]**: `and`, `or`, `not`, `is`, `in`
- **Variable [[Scope 1]]:** `global`, `nonlocal`
- **Context Management:** `with`, `del`

#### How Keywords Work

When you write code, the [[compiler]] or interpreter scans the code for these keywords to understand what operations to perform. For example, in Python, writing `if` followed by a [[Boolean Expression (Condition)|condition]] tells the program to execute the block of code that follows only if the condition is true.
