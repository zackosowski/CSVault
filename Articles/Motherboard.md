A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a [[Computers and Computing|computer]]. It serves as the primary hub that connects all the essential components of a computer system together, like the [[CPU  (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]], [[RAM (Random Access Memory)|RAM]], storage devices (such as [[HDD (Hard Disk Drive)|hard drives]] and [[SSD (Solid State Drive)|SSDs]]), expansion cards (like graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards), and various connectors for peripherals.

The motherboard provides electrical connections and pathways that allow [[Data]] and power to flow between the different components of the computer. It also contains important circuitry and components such as the chipset, which controls communication between the CPU and other devices, and the BIOS/UEFI firmware, which initializes the [[Computer Hardware|hardware]] during the boot process and provides basic system settings.

Different motherboards support different types of CPUs, memory modules, and expansion cards, so choosing the right motherboard is essential when building or upgrading a computer system. Motherboards come in various form factors, such as ATX, Micro ATX, and Mini ITX, which determine their physical size and compatibility with different cases and components.

Overall, the motherboard is a crucial component of any computer system, providing the foundation for all other hardware components to work together effectively.
