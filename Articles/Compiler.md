A **compiler** is a special program that translates code written in one programming language (the source language) into another language (the target language). Most often, the target language is [[Machine Code|machine code,]] which is the set of instructions a computer's central processing unit ([[CPU  (Central Processing Unit)|CPU]]) can execute directly.

#### Importance

Compilers are essential because they allow programmers to write code in high-level languages like [[Python]], Java, or C++. High-level languages are easier to understand and write than machine code, making programming more accessible and efficient.
