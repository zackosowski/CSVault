**Programming naming conventions** are a set of rules and guidelines used to create names for variables, functions, classes, and other entities in code. These conventions improve readability and maintainability, making it easier for programmers to understand and collaborate on a project. Below are some common naming conventions used in various programming languages:

---
#### Lowercase
Lowercase naming uses only small letters, typically for short variable names. This convention is common in languages like Python for simple, single-word variables.
```python
count = 10
```

---
#### Uppercase
Uppercase naming uses all capital letters, often with underscores separating words. It's frequently used for constants, which are values that should not change during the execution of a program.
```python
MAX_SIZE = 100
```

---
#### Snake Case
Snake case involves using lowercase letters with underscores to separate words. This convention is widely used in Python for variable and function names.
```python
total_count = 5
```

---
#### Camel Case
Camel case uses a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters where each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter. There are two types: **lower camel case** and **upper camel case**.
- **Lower camel case** starts with a lowercase letter and is used for variable and function names.
  ```java
  int totalCount = 5;
  ```
- **Upper camel case**, also known as Pascal case, starts with an uppercase letter and is typically used for class names.
  ```java
  class StudentRecord {
  }
  ```

#### Kebab Case
Kebab case uses lowercase letters with hyphens separating words. This convention is mainly used in URLs and sometimes in configuration files but is not commonly used in most programming languages due to syntax restrictions.
```html
background-color: blue;
```
