A hard disk drive, or HDD for short, is a type of permanent storage component that some computers use.

#### "Hard Disk"
<hr>
The term "hard disk" refers to the spinning CD-like disks called a "platters" that are housed inside of the hard drive. The platters contain countless microscopic magnetic particles that can be flipped north (1) or south (0). Data is read and saved from the platters using components called read/write heads.

Typically, you would never open the box or remove the disk unless it needs repair or recovery after failing. Power is only needed to read or write to the disk, and that data stays on the disk after the power is turned off. 

#### How does it work?
<hr>
To store data in a hard drive, [[RAM (Random Access Memory)|RAM]] sends data and instructions to the HDD and it translates that data into voltage fluctuations.
 * Some signals spin the platters, others move the read/write heads
* Pulses sent to the read/write head turn on a magnet which creates a field that changes the polarity of a tiny portion of the metal platter’s surface
* Power is sent in different directions as to change polarity
- To read, the particles on the disk use their charge to move the read/write head.
- Pieces of a file can be spread out around the platters
    - A special file keeps track of data’s location on the disk

#### Downsides of Hard Drives
<hr>
While hard drives were the gold standard for computer storage for many years, they have declined in usage over the last decade due to the dip in cost of [[SSD (Solid State Drive)|solid state drives]], which have many crucial benefits.

The major issue with hard drives is that the contain moving parts (the spinning platter) which makes them inherently fragile. If the hard drive gets bumped or moved while it is spinning, things go wrong fast.
* Corrupt files
* Unrecognized drive
* Slow to read/write

You can imagine before SSDs, hard drives were a major headache in laptops, which are always moving around!

	<summary>How does the process of storing data on a hard drive differ from simply writing information on a piece of paper?</summary>
		<p style="font-style: italic">Data is encoded onto a hard drive as 1's and 0s. Writing onto a piece of paper allows you to use any symbol or sketch.</p>
