Operating systems (OS) manage your computer in every way. It's the software that acts as an intermediary between the hardware of your [[Computers and Computing|computer]] (like the [[CPU  (Central Processing Unit)|processor]], [[Memory]], and [[Permanent Storage Device|storage devices]]) and the applications you use (like web browsers, word processors, and games).

#### Usage
<hr>

Users interact with the operating system every time they use a computer or a device, whether that be a personal computer, laptop, phone, or even your refrigerator. The operating system provides a user interface through which users can interact with the computer and its applications.

There are generally two main types of user interfaces provided by operating systems:

**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:
	This is the most common type of interface, where users interact with graphical elements such as icons, windows, and menus using a mouse, touchpad, or touchscreen. Examples include the desktop environments in Windows, macOS, and many Linux distributions.
    
**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
	In a CLI, users interact with the operating system by typing commands into a text-based interface. This is often preferred by advanced users and system administrators for its efficiency and flexibility. Examples include the Command Prompt in Windows, Terminal in macOS, and various terminal emulators in Linux.
    

Users interact with the operating system through these interfaces to perform various tasks such as opening and managing files, installing and running applications, configuring system settings, and accessing hardware resources. So, in essence, every time you use your computer or device, you're interacting with the operating system, whether directly or indirectly.

#### Three Main OSs
<hr>

**Windows**:
	Developed by Microsoft, Windows is one of the most popular operating systems for personal computers. It's known for its user-friendly interface and compatibility with a wide range of software and hardware.
    
**macOS**:
	Developed by Apple, macOS is the operating system used exclusively on Apple Macintosh computers. It's known for its sleek design, stability, and integration with other Apple products and services.
    
**Linux**:
	Linux is a bit different from Windows and macOS because it's an open-source operating system. This means that its source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. There are many different versions, called distributions or "distros," each tailored for different purposes, from general desktop use to servers and specialized applications.
    

Each operating system has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use often depends on factors like personal preference, compatibility with specific software, and the intended use of the computer.
