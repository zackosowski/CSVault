An integer is a data type used to represent whole numbers, both positive and negative, without any fractional or decimal components. Integers are one of the most fundamental data types in programming and are used for a wide range of purposes, including counting, indexing, arithmetic operations, and representing quantities that can only be whole numbers.

Integers are typically stored in [[Binary]] format in [[Memory]], and the range of values that can be represented depends on the number of [[Binary|bits]] used to store them. For example, an 8-bit integer can represent values from -128 to 127 (signed) or from 0 to 255 (unsigned), while a 32-bit integer can represent much larger values.

In most programming languages, integers are represented by keywords like "int" or "integer", and they can be used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Integers are also commonly used in control structures like loops and conditional statements to control the flow of a program based on numerical conditions.

Overall, integers are essential for a wide range of computational tasks in programming and are a fundamental building block of virtually all computer programs.
