	* Why would you rather use Google Docs over Notepad?
	* Programs designed to write code are called [[IDE (Integrated Development Environment)|Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)]]
		* Designed to make programming as easy as possible
		* Red underline = [[Compiler Error]]
		* Yellow underline = [[Warning]]
		* Code is runnable with [[Terminal]] input/output
3. Open and setup [[Visual Studio Code|VS Code]] for python programming. 
	* Open VS Code by searching for it on your computer
		* Before opening, right click -> pin to taskbar
	* Overview of [VS Code user interface](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface)
	* Install Extensions:
