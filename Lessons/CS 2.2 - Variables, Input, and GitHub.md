#### Targets
I can create and log in to my [Git and GitHub](app://obsidian.md/Git%20and%20GitHub) account.

I can use GitHub commands to clone, pull, and push updates to a repository.

I can apply my understanding of variables to send variable messages to the terminal in Python.

I can apply my knowledge of the input function to accept user input in a Python program.

I can consolidate my understanding of both variables and the input function to create a question-answer type Python programming activity.
