1. Start by working through the first few slides of   the [[How Do Computers Work.pdf]] How do Computers Work slideshow presentation
2. Work through [[Data]] as a class
3. Work through [[Computers and Computing#Inputs and Outputs|inputs and outputs]]
	* Students complete inputs and outputs activity
4. Work through [[Algorithms]] as a class
5. Students read [[Sorting Algorithms]] independently
6. Students partner up to complete the sorting algorithms [[Sorting Algorithms#<span style="color 7b6cd9; border 2px solid 7b6cd9; padding 3px">ACTIVITY</span>|activity]].
