#### Targets
<hr>
I can apply my understanding of the binary number system to translate to and from bytes of binary data.

I can apply my understanding of character mapping systems to translate to and from bytes of binary data to ASCII characters.

#### Lesson
<hr>
1. Introduction
	* "Computers on understand 1s and 0s"
	* How can computers of today do so much if the can only use 1s and 0s?
	* They don't even have the whole alphabet!
	* Is programming just writing a bunch of 1s and 0s?
2. Work through [[Binary]] as a class
	* Students complete questions and activity
3. Review questions and activity
4. Character Mapping
	* "If computers can only make numbers, how do we get letters?"
	* Work through [[Character Mapping]] as a class
	* Students complete questions and activity
